# Comments Midterm Isit322 2017

This document contains Charlie's comments on your Isit322 2017 Midterm.

This is very good, Elizabeth. You did a great job.

My complaints:

- You are using PRE rather than setting up fields for each of the properties.
- This is probably one of the reasons you have few tests that others.
- If you didn't want to set up the fields by hands, our ElfElement code could have automated it for you.
- You didn't tell me that I needed a token with notifications on it and that I needed to set up an environment variable. I think it would have been nice to trust me with a working key, or at least made it very clear how to set up the app.

Overall, this is very good. You are starting to get good at this Elizabeth. You should be proud of what you have accomplished and of your talent as a developer. You are getting to be one of the better students in the class, and we have a several smart folks in the room this year.

## Basics

Your application has a styled menu and supports component switching. You included the following menu items:

- **Home**
- **GetFoo**
- **SmallNumbers**

## Additional Requests

- You made at least one more request of the GitHub API
- You Included the results of these requests in the menu
- Your app switches between your Git request views

## Tests and Polish

- You have 28 test in 5 test suites. You could have a few more.
- JSCS is available but I'm getting some punctuator and other minor errors.
- Your code runs without warnings and errors once I understood how to set it up.

## Extra Credit

Your **git-convert** program spits out field definition files. Very nice. In fact, you nailed this, calling curl and producing the right files automatically. Very nice.
