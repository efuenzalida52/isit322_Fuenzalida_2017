You earned an A- for the quarter.

You helped other students quite a bit. Please sit up closer in your next class. You need to fully commit yourself.

## GitExplorer

- Compiles and runs with concurrency from GitExplorer/server directory
- Runs with a couple errors on the Gist components, but otherwise very clean.
  - One or two warnings at start up.
- Does load from MongoDB

## Features

- Get User info does load properly.  
- Create Gist does not load properly.
- List Gists does not load properly.
  - Delete Gist doesn't work
- You do use another feature of the Git API: notifications
- Redux
  - I don't see much Redux. If there is any, it is hard to find.

The gists did work back in Week08. I remember. So I'll give you some credit for that.

## Micro Services

You:

- Started at least two micro services with concurrently
- Use the database from a micro service

## Heroku

I don't think you ever sent me a link to your program running on Heroku. If I'm wrong, let me know.

## Native

After minor tweaking, this loads on my phone, but I get some redux related errors. Good start though. We needed to work on this longer.

## Tests

Basic stats reported after run all:

```
Test Suites: 1 failed, 4 passed, 5 total
Tests:       1 failed, 27 passed, 28 total
```

That is nice. 27 pass and only one fails.
